# Snake-Neural-Network
A beginner project I am in the midst of creating to get into neural networks using the javascript language

Libraries:
P5.js - Lauren McCarthy

Collaborators:
Hopefully Snowcloak - Assisted in the logic and flow of the program

I plan to use an artificial neural network and the snakes will learn through evolution
The snakes will be evaluated when dead and the best snake will be chosen to reproduce with mutations
